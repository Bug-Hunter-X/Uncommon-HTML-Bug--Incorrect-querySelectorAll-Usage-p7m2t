# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect querySelectorAll Usage

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug that can occur when using `document.querySelectorAll` in HTML. The bug arises from an incorrect assumption about how `querySelectorAll` handles selectors that don't match any elements, specifically using a space in the selector when the intended element does not have a class.  This can lead to runtime errors if not handled properly.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs because the code assumes that `querySelectorAll` will return an empty NodeList if the selector does not match any elements. However, if the selector is invalid (such as containing a space with no matching element having the specified class), `querySelectorAll` might not return an empty NodeList, leading to unexpected behavior and errors. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the error in the browser's console.

## Solution
The solution involves checking if the returned NodeList is empty or if the first element exists to make sure there are no runtime errors.
